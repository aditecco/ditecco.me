Hi there! I'm Alessandro Di Tecco, front-end
developer.

I love the open web and I'm passionate about
building products &amp; experiences with code.

This website is a collection of my most
significant works and projects.

To get in touch with me you can [send me an e-mail](mailto:alessandro@ditecco.me) (old fashioned!).
