In 2012 in Verona there was no shortage of professionals and companies renting excess office space; yet, there wasn't any company whose only focus was offering young freelancers &amp; startups a place to work, for a reasonable price.

[The Collective](/archive/the-collective/) was built around this exact need, and effectively filled this void as the first state-of-the-art coworking space in Verona.

The Collective brought a lot of people together: some of them became business partners, others just good friends. Some people elected the space as a second house, some others realized it was the right place to work on those projects they kept in a closet for too long. Others were so inspired they decided to try and build a coworking space on their own. Either way, The Collective made a lasting impact.
