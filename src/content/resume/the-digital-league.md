The coolest tech events in Italy, both big or small, are usually held only in major cities like Milan or Rome. I've been thinking of a way to bring them to Verona, my city, since 2009. It was only after 2 years, in 2011, that I founded [The Digital League:](/archive/the-digital-league/) a non-profit association aiming to bring the best national/international tech &amp; digital events to Verona. By gathering people around topics such as internet culture, tehnology, startup &amp; entrepreneurship, The Digital League aimed to create a local digital community.

Here are TDL's most significant achievements:

- Founded The Collective, the first authentic coworking space in Verona;
- Created DigitalDrink, a networking event that gave several startups the opportunity to pitch their product to a selected audience;
- Created connections and relationships, in the form of media partnerships, with many tech conferences in Italy and abroad;
- Contributed to Startup Weekend Verona 2012 with a paid sponsorship.
