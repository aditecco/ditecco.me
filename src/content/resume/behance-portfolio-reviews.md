I was the lead organizer of Behance Portfolio Reviews Verona 2014, for the first time ever in the city.

Behance Portfolio Review is a networking event aimed specifically at creatives, with the purpose of promoting the practice of design critique.

As an organizer, I took care of:

- Marketing the event;
- Selling tickets;
- Preparing the event location (before &amp; after the event);
- Running the event;
- Communicating with Behance HQ in US.

Credits: a big help for recruiting Special Guests and Review Leaders came from Stefano Torregrossa &amp; Matteo Cuccato, who leveraged their personal and professional network for the cause.
