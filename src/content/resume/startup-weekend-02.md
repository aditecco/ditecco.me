I was one of the 3-people-team who organized [Startup Weekend Verona 2012,](https://web.archive.org/web/20121217072032/http://verona.startupweekend.org/) for the first time ever in the city.

Organizing a Startup Weekend is no easy task: it involves a lot of planning and the ability to wear many different hats:

1.  Finding sponsors;
2.  Recruiting Coaches and Jury members;
3.  Marketing the event;
4.  Doing PR for the event;
5.  Selling tickets and providing customer service;
6.  Preparing the event location (before &amp; after the event);
7.  Running the event, &amp; making sure it follows the planned schedule;
8.  Assigning prizes, and communicating with the sponsors who make them available;
9.  Doing admin work (collecting payments, invoicing, etc);
10. Constantly communicating with Startup Weekend HQ in US.

I worked mostly in areas 02, 03, 05, 06, 08.

I also created the event identity: [&rarr; Startup Weekend Verona 2012](/archive/simplest/work/startup-weekend-verona/)

Thanks to the work of everyone involved the event was a success, with 120+ attendees.
