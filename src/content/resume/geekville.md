Founded in oct. 2013, [Geekville](/archive/geekville/en/) was a coworking space for digital and creative professionals operating in the Verona area.

Inspired by the coolest startup HQs, Geekville was no ordinary workplace; while providing state-of-the-art office facilities, its friendly and creative vibe encouraged socializing and knowledge sharing among coworkers.

Geekville also created courses and workshops under the dedicated branch Geekville Learning.
