title: "2011 - 2016 â€” Simplest"
subtitle: "Freelance User Interface Designer"
---

I've been designing interfaces as a freelancer since #{startYear}; starting from 2015, I decided to create my solo User Interface Design studio: I called it Simplest, to remind myself that the simplest user interfaces &amp; interactions are the building blocks of the best digital experiences.

Over the course of 5 years I designed a diverse range of digital products, often taking care of the full product image:

- web-app UIs
- mobile UIs
- product/marketing websites
- e-commerce
- landing pages
- identity, marketing visuals, banners, etc

Moreover, given my past entrepreneurial experience, I developed a solid understanding of what building a product means: from design (both in the physical and digital realm) to marketing &amp; sales, pricing, admin, client acquisition, client retention, customer care, and all the daily problem-solving founders are accustomed to.
