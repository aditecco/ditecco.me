In april 2013, [H-Farm](http://www.h-farmventures.com/en/) (one of the top italian startup accelerators) organized and hosted [Startup Weekend Venice 2013;](https://web.archive.org/web/20131115072955/http://venice.startupweekend.org/) I was invited to join the event as a Coach.

The role of Coaches in Startup Weekend's formula is an important one: a Coach is basically an expert in his field &mdash; in my case, UI Design &amp; Logo Design &mdash; who follows each team and contributes with his knowledge.
