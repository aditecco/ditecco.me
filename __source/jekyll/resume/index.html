# <span class="underline">The full story*</span>

(*) This isn't exactly a résumé; it's more of a story of my professional path so far. However, those who don't have the time to read all this stuff will appreciate the previous "Quick Outline" section.

<br>

## 2011 - 2016 &mdash; Simplest
#### Freelance User Interface Designer

I've been designing interfaces as a freelancer since 2011; starting from 2015, I decided to create my solo User Interface Design studio: I called it Simplest, to remind myself that the simplest user interfaces &amp; interactions are the building blocks of the best digital experiences.

Over the past 5 years I designed a diverse range of digital products, often taking care of the full product image, from identity to marketing visuals: subscription e-commerce sites, highly detailed web apps, multi-platform apps, & more. [&rarr; Check out my works](http://www.simplest.io)

Moreover, given my current entrepreneurial experience in building and managing a coworking space, I developed an understanding of what it means to build a product: from design (both in the physical and digital realm) to marketing & sales, pricing, admin, client acquisition, client retention, customer care, and all the daily problem-solving founders are accustomed to.

## 2013 - 2016 &mdash; Geekville
#### Creator, Co-Founder, All-around Designer

Founded in oct. 2013, Geekville is a coworking space for digital and creative professionals operating in the Verona area. [&rarr; Visit the website](http://www.geekville.it)

Inspired by the coolest startup HQs, Geekville is no ordinary workplace; while providing state-of-the-art office facilities, its friendly and creative vibe encourages socializing and knowledge sharing among coworkers.

Geekville also creates courses and workshops with its learning branch [&rarr; Geekville Learning](http://www.geekvillelearning.it)

Credits: Geekville has been founded and built with the help of my business associate Francesco Adami, with whom I'm running the company today.

<hr class="separator" />

## 2012 - 2013 &mdash; The Collective
#### Creator, Co-Founder, All-around Designer

In 2012 in Verona there weren't any significant coworking spaces; sure, there were plenty of professionals &amp; companies with more office space than they needed, who rented their spare rooms making some cash in the process: but I call this subletting, not coworking.

So, there wasn't any company whose only focus was offering young professionals &amp; startups a place to work, for a reasonable price. The Collective was built around this exact need, and effectively filled this void as the first authentic, state-of-the-art coworking space in Verona.

During its life span The Collective brought a lot of people together: some of them became business partners, others just good friends. Some people elected the space as a second house, some others realized it was the right place to work on those projects they kept in a closet for too long. Others were so inspired they decided to try and build a coworking space on their own. Either way, The Collective made a lasting impact.

Credits: a big help in building and running The Collective came from my business associate Francesco Adami, with whom I'm currently running Geekville.

## 2011 - 2013 &mdash; The Digital League
#### Founder, All-around Designer

The coolest tech events in Italy, both big or small, are usually held only in major cities like Milan or Rome. I've been thinking of a way to bring them to Verona, my city, since 2009. It was only after 2 years, in 2011, that I founded The Digital League: a non-profit association aiming to bring the best national/international tech &amp; digital events to Verona . By gathering people around topics such as internet culture, tehnology, startup &amp; entrepreneurship, TDL aimed to create a local digital community.

In its 2 years of existence TDL accomplished a number of remarkable things:

* Founded The Collective, the first authentic coworking space in Verona;
* Created DigitalDrink, a networking event that gave several startups the opportunity to pitch their product to a selected audience;
* Created connections and relationships, in the form of media partnerships, with many tech conferences in Italy and abroad;
* Contributed to Startup Weekend Verona 2012 with a paid sponsorship.

## 01-06/2011 &mdash; Ninja Marketing
#### Contributing writer

Ninja Marketing is one of the leading Italian marketing blogs, with a focus on unconventional &amp; social media marketing.

## 04-06/2011 &mdash; Ninja Marketing
#### Editor

The Design Section introduced a big change in NM's marketing-centric tradition; as an editor I was given the task of launching the new section, establishing an editorial line, and recruiting a team of contributors. [&rarr; Read my post for the launch of Ninja Marketing Design (in Italian)](http://www.ninjamarketing.it/2011/04/19/ninja-marketing-speaks-design-al-via-la-nuova-sezione-dedicata-alle-arti-visive-a-tutto-tondo/)

<hr class="separator" />

## 2010 - 2011 &mdash; Clab Comunicazione
#### Copywriter

Clab Comunicazione is an ad agency. I worked mainly as a Copywriter, but I was also in charge of everything digital (websites, online adv, et al) both from a design &amp; management standpoint.

<hr class="separator" />

## 2007 - 2009 &mdash; BCF
#### Copywriter

BCF is an advertising agency & industrial design studio with 30+ years of experience. I worked mainly as a Copywriter, but also did a number of other things such as pitching creative projects to top agency clients and managing digital projects.

## 03-05/2014 &mdash; Behance Portfolio Reviews
#### Organizer

I was the lead organizer of Behance Portfolio Reviews Verona 2014, for the first time ever in the city: [&rarr; Behance Portfolio Reviews Verona 2014](http://www.geekvillelearning.it/offerta-formativa/behance-portfolio-review-verona/)

Behance Portfolio Review is a networking event aimed specifically at creatives, with the purpose of promoting the practice of design critique.

As an organizer, I took care of:

* Marketing the event;
* Selling tickets;
* Preparing the event location (before &amp; after the event);
* Running the event;
* Communicating with Behance HQ in US.

Credits: a big help for recruiting Special Guests and Review Leaders came from Stefano Torregrossa &amp; Matteo Cuccato, who leveraged their personal and professional network for the cause.

## 04/2013 &mdash; Startup Weekend
#### Coach

In april 2013, [H-Farm](http://www.h-farmventures.com/en/) (one of the top italian startup accelerators) organized and hosted Startup Weekend Venice; I was invited to join the event as a Coach: [&rarr; Startup Weekend Venice 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131115072955/http://venice.startupweekend.org/)

The role of Coaches in Startup Weekend's formula is an important one: a Coach is basically an expert in his field &mdash; in my case, UI Design &amp; Logo Design &mdash; who follows each team and contributes with his knowledge.

<hr class="separator" />

## 10-12/2012 &mdash; Startup Weekend
#### Organizer

I was one of the 3-people-team who organized Startup Weekend Verona 2012, for the first time ever in the city: [&rarr; Startup Weekend Verona 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20121217072032/http://verona.startupweekend.org/)

Organizing a Startup Weekend is no easy task: it involves a lot of planning and the ability to wear many different hats:

1. Finding sponsors;
2. Recruiting Coaches and Jury members;
3. Marketing the event;
4. Doing PR for the event;
5. Selling tickets and providing customer service;
6. Preparing the event location (before &amp; after the event);
7. Running the event, &amp; making sure it follows the planned schedule;
8. Assigning prizes, and communicating with the sponsors who make them available;
9. Doing admin work (collecting payments, invoicing, etc);
10. Constantly communicating with Startup Weekend HQ in US.

I worked mostly in areas 02, 03, 05, 06, 08.
I also created the event identity: [&rarr; Startup Weekend Verona 2012 on Simplest](http://www.simplest.io/work/startup-weekend-verona.html)

Thanks to the work of everyone involved the event was a great success, with 120+ attendees.
