				h2 2011 - 2017 &mdash; Simplest
				h4 Freelance User Interface Designer

			.story-block-body
				p I've been designing interfaces as a freelancer since 2011; starting from 2015, I decided to create my solo User Interface Design studio: I called it Simplest, to remind myself that the simplest user interfaces &amp; interactions are the building blocks of the best digital experiences.

				p Over the past 6 years I designed a diverse range of digital products, often taking care of the full product image, from identity to marketing visuals: subscription e-commerce sites, highly detailed web apps, multi-platform apps, &amp; more. #[a(href='http://www.simplest.io/?ref=dtc-resume', target='_blank') &rarr; check out my works]

				p Moreover, given my past entrepreneurial experience in building and managing a coworking space, I developed a solid understanding of what it means to build a product: from design (both in the physical and digital realm) to marketing &amp; sales, pricing, admin, client acquisition, client retention, customer care, and all the daily problem-solving founders are accustomed to.

				h4 Creator, Co-Founder, All-around Designer

			.story-block-body
				p Founded in oct. 2013, #[a(href='/archive/geekville/en/', target='_blank') Geekville] was a coworking space for digital and creative professionals operating in the Verona area.

				p Inspired by the coolest startup HQs, Geekville was no ordinary workplace; while providing state-of-the-art office facilities, its friendly and creative vibe encouraged socializing and knowledge sharing among coworkers.

				p Geekville also created courses and workshops under the dedicated brand #[a(href='http://www.geekvillelearning.it', target='_blank') &rarr; Geekville Learning]

				p Credits: I founded, built and ran Geekville with the help of my business associate Francesco Adami.

				h2 2012 - 2013 &mdash; The Collective
				h4 Creator, Co-Founder, All-around Designer

			.story-block-body
				p In 2012 in Verona there weren't any significant coworking spaces; sure, there were plenty of professionals &amp; companies with more office space than they needed, who rented their spare rooms making some cash in the process: but I call this subletting, not coworking.

				p So, there wasn't any company whose only focus was offering young professionals &amp; startups a place to work, for a reasonable price. #[a(href='/archive/the-collective/', target='_blank') The Collective] was built around this exact need, and effectively filled this void as the first authentic, state-of-the-art coworking space in Verona.

				p During its life span The Collective brought a lot of people together: some of them became business partners, others just good friends. Some people elected the space as a second house, some others realized it was the right place to work on those projects they kept in a closet for too long. Others were so inspired they decided to try and build a coworking space on their own. Either way, The Collective made a lasting impact.

				p Credits: a big help in building and running The Collective came from my business associate Francesco Adami.

				h4 Founder, All-around Designer

			.story-block-body
				p The coolest tech events in Italy, both big or small, are usually held only in major cities like Milan or Rome. I've been thinking of a way to bring them to Verona, my city, since 2009. It was only after 2 years, in 2011, that I founded #[a(href='/archive/the-digital-league/', target='_blank') The Digital League:] a non-profit association aiming to bring the best national/international tech &amp; digital events to Verona. By gathering people around topics such as internet culture, tehnology, startup &amp; entrepreneurship, TDL aimed to create a local digital community.

				p Here's the most significant achievements of TDL:

				ul
					li Founded The Collective, the first authentic coworking space in Verona;
					li Created DigitalDrink, a networking event that gave several startups the opportunity to pitch their product to a selected audience;
					li Created connections and relationships, in the form of media partnerships, with many tech conferences in Italy and abroad;
					li Contributed to Startup Weekend Verona 2012 with a paid sponsorship.

				p The role of Coaches in Startup Weekend's formula is an important one: a Coach is basically an expert in his field &mdash; in my case, UI Design &amp; Logo Design &mdash; who follows each team and contributes with his knowledge.
