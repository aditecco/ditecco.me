					h4 Freelance User Interface Designer

				.story-block-body
					p I've been designing interfaces as a freelancer since 2011; starting from 2015, I decided to create my solo User Interface Design studio: I called it Simplest, to remind myself that the simplest user interfaces &amp; interactions are the building blocks of the best digital experiences.

					p Over the past #{since} years I designed a diverse range of digital products, often taking care of the full product image, from identity to marketing visuals: subscription e-commerce sites, highly detailed web apps, multi-platform apps, &amp; more. #[a(href='http://www.simplest.io/?ref=dtc-resume', target='_blank') &rarr; check out my works]

					p Moreover, given my past entrepreneurial experience in building and managing a coworking space, I developed a solid understanding of what building a product means: from design (both in the physical and digital realm) to marketing &amp; sales, pricing, admin, client acquisition, client retention, customer care, and all the daily problem-solving founders are accustomed to.

				.story-block-body
					p Founded in oct. 2013, #[a(href='/archive/geekville/en/', target='_blank') Geekville] was a coworking space for digital and creative professionals operating in the Verona area.

					p Inspired by the coolest startup HQs, Geekville was no ordinary workplace; while providing state-of-the-art office facilities, its friendly and creative vibe encouraged socializing and knowledge sharing among coworkers.

					//- should create an archived version of GVL
					//- p Geekville also created courses and workshops under the dedicated brand #[a(href='http://www.geekvillelearning.it', target='_blank') &rarr; Geekville Learning]

					p Geekville also created courses and workshops under the dedicated brand Geekville Learning.

					p Credits: I founded, built and ran Geekville with the help of my business associate Francesco Adami.

					h4 Creator, Co-Founder, All-around Designer

				.story-block-body
					p In 2012 in Verona there weren't any significant coworking spaces; sure, there were plenty of professionals &amp; companies with more office space than they needed, who rented their spare rooms making some cash in the process: but I call this subletting, not coworking.

					p So, there wasn't any company whose only focus was offering young professionals &amp; startups a place to work, for a reasonable price. #[a(href='/archive/the-collective/', target='_blank') The Collective] was built around this exact need, and effectively filled this void as the first state-of-the-art coworking space in Verona.

					p During its life span The Collective brought a lot of people together: some of them became business partners, others just good friends. Some people elected the space as a second house, some others realized it was the right place to work on those projects they kept in a closet for too long. Others were so inspired they decided to try and build a coworking space on their own. Either way, The Collective made a lasting impact.

					p Credits: a big help in building and running The Collective came from my business associate Francesco Adami.

					h4 Founder, All-around Designer

				.story-block-body
					p The coolest tech events in Italy, both big or small, are usually held only in major cities like Milan or Rome. I've been thinking of a way to bring them to Verona, my city, since 2009. It was only after 2 years, in 2011, that I founded #[a(href='/archive/the-digital-league/', target='_blank') The Digital League:] a non-profit association aiming to bring the best national/international tech &amp; digital events to Verona. By gathering people around topics such as internet culture, tehnology, startup &amp; entrepreneurship, The Digital League aimed to create a local digital community.

					p Here are its most significant achievements:

					ul
						li Founded The Collective, the first authentic coworking space in Verona;
						li Created DigitalDrink, a networking event that gave several startups the opportunity to pitch their product to a selected audience;
						li Created connections and relationships, in the form of media partnerships, with many tech conferences in Italy and abroad;
						li Contributed to Startup Weekend Verona 2012 with a paid sponsorship.

					p I was the lead organizer of #[a(href='http://www.geekvillelearning.it/offerta-formativa/behance-portfolio-review-verona/', target='_blank') Behance Portfolio Reviews Verona 2014,] for the first time ever in the city.

					p Behance Portfolio Review is a networking event aimed specifically at creatives, with the purpose of promoting the practice of design critique.

					p As an organizer, I took care of:

					ul
						li Marketing the event;
						li Selling tickets;
						li Preparing the event location (before &amp; after the event);
						li Running the event;
						li Communicating with Behance HQ in US.

					p Credits: a big help for recruiting Special Guests and Review Leaders came from Stefano Torregrossa &amp; Matteo Cuccato, who leveraged their personal and professional network for the cause.

					p The role of Coaches in Startup Weekend's formula is an important one: a Coach is basically an expert in his field &mdash; in my case, UI Design &amp; Logo Design &mdash; who follows each team and contributes with his knowledge.

					p Organizing a Startup Weekend is no easy task: it involves a lot of planning and the ability to wear many different hats:

					ol
						li Finding sponsors;
						li Recruiting Coaches and Jury members;
						li Marketing the event;
						li Doing PR for the event;
						li Selling tickets and providing customer service;
						li Preparing the event location (before &amp; after the event);

						li Assigning prizes, and communicating with the sponsors who make them available;
						li Doing admin work (collecting payments, invoicing, etc);
						li Constantly communicating with Startup Weekend HQ in US.

					p I worked mostly in areas 02, 03, 05, 06, 08.

					p I also created the event identity: #[a(href='http://www.simplest.io/work/startup-weekend-verona.html?ref=dtc-resume', target='_blank') &rarr; Startup Weekend Verona 2012 on Simplest]

					p Thanks to the work of everyone involved the event was a success, with 120+ attendees.
