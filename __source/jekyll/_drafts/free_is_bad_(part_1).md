# Free is bad (part 1)
##### Written on Friday, 13-02-2015

## Free in the retail business

### You lose money
### The perceived value of what you're selling sinks
### Your efforts are not respected


## Free in client services

### The perceived value of what you're selling sinks
### You poison the market for your fellow freelancers
### Your efforts are not respected
### Visibility: just a promise no one can guarantee
### Think they'll owe you? Think again
### Bonus: Free in Italy and the fact that you're expected to work for free (or compensated with intangible benefits)
