					<h1><span class="underline">The full story*</span></h1>					
					<p>(*) This isn&#8217;t exactly a r&eacute;sum&eacute;; it&#8217;s more of a story of my professional path so far. However, those who don&#8217;t have the time to read all this stuff will appreciate the previous &#8220;Quick Outline&#8221; section.</p>

					<h2>2011 - 2015 &mdash; Simplest</h2>
					<h4>Freelance User Interface Designer</h4>
					
					<p>I&#8217;ve been designing interfaces as a freelancer since 2011; starting from 2015, I decided to create my solo User Interface Design studio: I called it Simplest, to remind myself that the simplest user interfaces &amp; interactions are the building blocks of the best digital experiences.</p>
					
					<p>Over the past 4 years I designed a diverse range of digital products, often taking care of the full product image, from identity to marketing visuals: subscription e-commerce sites, highly detailed web apps, multi-platform apps, &amp; more. <a href="http://www.simplest.io">See all my works on Simplest</a></p>
					
					<p>Moreover, given my current entrepreneurial experience in building and managing a coworking space, I developed an understanding of what it means to build a product: from design (both in the physical and digital realm) to marketing &amp; sales, pricing, admin, client acquisition, client retention, customer care, and all the daily problem-solving founders are accustomed to.</p>

					<h2>2013 - 2015 &mdash; Geekville</h2>
					<h4>Creator, Co-Founder, All-around Designer</h4>
					
					<p>Founded in oct. 2013, Geekville is a coworking space for digital and creative professionals operating in the Verona area.</p>
					
					<p>Inspired by the coolest startup HQs, Geekville is no ordinary workplace; while providing state-of-the-art office facilities, its friendly and creative vibe encourages socializing and knowledge sharing among coworkers: <a href="http://www.geekville.it">Geekville Coworking</a></p>
					
					<p>Geekville also creates courses and workshops with its learning branch <a href="http://www.geekvillelearning.it">Geekville Learning</a></p>
					
					<p>Credits: Geekville has been founded and built with the help of my business associate Francesco Adami, with whom I&#8217;m running the company today.</p>
					
					<hr class="separator" />
					
					<h2>2011 - 2013 &mdash; The Collective</h2>
					<h4>Creator, Co-Founder, All-around Designer</h4>
					
					<p>In 2012 in Verona there weren&#8217;t any significant coworking spaces; sure, there were plenty of professionals &amp; companies with more office space than they needed, who rented their spare rooms making some cash in the process: but I call this subletting, not coworking.</p>
					
					<p>So, there wasn&#8217;t any company whose only focus was offering young professionals &amp; startups a place to work, for a reasonable price. The Collective was built around this exact need, and effectively filled this void as the first authentic, state-of-the-art coworking space in Verona.</p>
					
					<p>During its life span The Collective brought a lot of people together: some of them became business partners, others just good friends. Some people elected the space as a second house, some others realized it was the right place to work on those projects they kept in a closet for too long. Others were so inspired they decided to try and build a coworking space on their own. Either way, The Collective made a lasting impact.</p>
					
					<p>Credits: a big help in building and running The Collective came from my business associate Francesco Adami, with whom I&#8217;m currently running Geekville.</p>
					
					<hr class="separator" />
					
					<h2>2011 - 2013 &mdash; The Digital League</h2>
					<h4>Founder, All-around Designer</h4>
					
					<p>The coolest tech events in Italy, both big or small, are usually held only in major cities like Milan or Rome. I&#8217;ve been thinking of a way to bring them to Verona, my city, since 2009. It was only after 2 years, in 2011, that I founded The Digital League: a non-profit association aiming to bring the best national/international tech &amp; digital events to Verona . By gathering people around topics such as internet culture, tehnology, startup &amp; entrepreneurship, TDL aimed to create a local digital community.</p>
					
					<p>In its 2 years of existence TDL accomplished a number of remarkable things:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Founded The Collective, the first authentic coworking space in Verona;</li>
						<li>Created DigitalDrink, a networking event that gave several startups the opportunity to pitch their product to a selected audience;</li>
						<li>Created connections and relationships, in the form of media partnerships, with many tech conferences in Italy and abroad;</li>
						<li>Contributed to Startup Weekend Verona 2012 with a paid sponsorship.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>01&#8211;06/2011 &mdash; Ninja Marketing</h2>
					<h4>Contributing writer</h4>
					
					<p>Ninja Marketing is one of the leading Italian marketing blogs, with a focus on unconventional &amp; social media marketing.</p>
					
					<p>As a contributor for the Startup section I wrote news and features, interviews and analysis about the Italian startup scene. <a href="http://www.ninjamarketing.it/author/alessandro-ditecco/">Read my posts on Ninja Marketing (in Italian)</a></p>
					<hr class="separator" />
					
					<h2>04&#8211;06/2011 &mdash; Ninja Marketing</h2>
					<h4>Editor</h4>
					
					<p>The Design Section introduced a big change in NM&#8217;s marketing-centric tradition; as an editor I was given the task of launching the new section, establishing an editorial line, and recruiting a team of contributors. <a href="http://www.ninjamarketing.it/2011/04/19/ninja-marketing-speaks-design-al-via-la-nuova-sezione-dedicata-alle-arti-visive-a-tutto-tondo/">Read my post for the launch of Ninja Marketing Design (in Italian)</a></p>
					
					<hr class="separator" />
					
					<h2>2010 - 2011 &mdash; Clab Comunicazione</h2>
					<h4>Copywriter</h4>
					
					<p>Clab Comunicazione is an ad agency. I worked mainly as a Copywriter, but I was also in charge of everything digital (websites, online adv, et al) both from a design &amp; management standpoint.</p>
					
					<hr class="separator" />
					
					<h2>2007 - 2009 &mdash; BCF</h2>
					<h4>Copywriter</h4>

					<h1><span class="underline">Other experiences</span></h1>
					
					<h2>03&#8211;05/2014 &mdash; Behance Portfolio Reviews</h2>
					<h4>Organizer</h4>
					
					<p>I was the lead organizer of Behance Portfolio Reviews Verona 2014, for the first time ever in the city: <a href="http://www.geekvillelearning.it/offerta-formativa/behance-portfolio-review-verona/">Behance Portfolio Reviews Verona 2014</a></p>
					
					<p>Behance Portfolio Review is a networking event aimed specifically at creatives, with the purpose of promoting the practice of design critique.</p>
					
					<p>As an organizer, I took care of:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Marketing the event;</li>
						<li>Selling tickets;</li>
						<li>Preparing the event location (before &amp; after the event);</li>
						<li>Running the event;</li>
						<li>Communicating with Behance HQ in US.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Credits: a big help for recruiting Special Guests and Review Leaders came from Stefano Torregrossa &amp; Matteo Cuccato, who leveraged their personal and professional network for the cause.</p>
					
					<hr class="separator" />
					
					<h2>04/2013 &mdash; Startup Weekend</h2>
					<h4>Coach</h4>
					
					<p>In april 2013, <a href="http://www.h-farmventures.com/en/">H-Farm</a> (one of the top italian startup accelerators) organized and hosted Startup Weekend Venice; I was invited to join the event as a Coach: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131115072955/http://venice.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Venice 2013</a></p>
					
					<p>The role of Coaches in Startup Weekend&#8217;s formula is an important one: a Coach is basically an expert in his field &mdash; in my case, UI Design &amp; Logo Design &mdash; who follows each team and contributes with his knowledge.</p>
					<hr class="separator" />
					
					<h2>10&#8211;12/2012 &mdash; Startup Weekend</h2>
					<h4>Organizer</h4>
					
					<p>I was one of the 3-people-team who organized Startup Weekend Verona 2012, for the first time ever in the city: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121217072032/http://verona.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Verona 2012</a></p>
					
					<p>Organizing a Startup Weekend is no easy task: it involves a lot of planning and the ability to wear many different hats:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Finding sponsors;</li>
						<li>Recruiting Coaches and Jury members;</li>
						<li>Marketing the event;</li>
						<li>Doing PR for the event;</li>
						<li>Selling tickets and providing customer service;</li>
						<li>Preparing the event location (before &amp; after the event);</li>
						<li>Running the event, &amp; making sure it follows the planned schedule;</li>
						<li>Assigning prizes, and communicating with the sponsors who make them available;</li>
						<li>Doing admin work (collecting payments, invoicing, etc);</li>
						<li>Constantly communicating with Startup Weekend HQ in US.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>I worked mostly in areas 02, 03, 05, 06, 08.
					I also created the event identity: <a href="http://www.simplest.io/work/startup-weekend-verona.html">Startup Weekend Verona 2012 on Simplest</a></p>
					
					<p>Thanks to the work of everyone involved the event was a great success, with 120+ attendees.</p>
